      SATURN
      <br>
      Federico de la Fe did not win a single game of loteria. He thought that perhaps an evil omen was at work. The only pictures he ever placed a bean over were <br>those of the devil and the grim reaper:<br>

      Little Merced did not win a game either, but none of her cards pointed to any signs of evil or premature death—only benign images of watermelons and banjos.
      Just before midnight they left the cobblestone bingo park and headed to the red-brick bus depot.
      They boarded Bus Number 8 on its north route to the border city of Tijuana. Federico de la Fe led Little Merced by the hand into the last two seats at the back of the bus, next to the toilet stall. Little Merced shoved her pillowcases beneath
      her
      seat and fell asleep across the burgundy cushions that smelled of sugarcane.
      Ten minutes after the bus pulled out of the brick bus depot, four miles into the trip, Federico de la Fe looked out the window and then down at his daughter. He felt a slight inkling of the old sadness and feared that if he fell asleep he would
      soak his seat.
      Out of this fear, Federico de la Fe went into the toilet stall and pulled out his sickle and heated it with a bit of phosphorus until it burned red. He lift¬ed his wool Sunday shirt and pressed the glowing red sickle into his stomach until the
      sadness receded.
